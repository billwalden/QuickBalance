# QuickBalance

####Purpose of App: 
  Education, this is my first android app.

####What is does:  
  QuickBalance retrieves and displays a US Bank account balance by using US Bank's "text banking" service. Additionally, the user can set QuickBalnce to "Run in background" and the app will periodically send texts to update the balance and alert the user if they are overdrafted.
  
####Requirements: 
  A US Bank account with text banking enabled (although, it could be easilly modified to work with any text service).
